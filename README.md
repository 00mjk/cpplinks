# C++ links

A categorized list of C++ resources.

Being a part of a few C++ communities, I happen to run across some interesting links -- this is an attempt to categorize them. Thanks to Saurabh Malpani from "C++ Enthusiasts" for the suggestion.

An ongoing, work-in-progress effort -- comments, feedback, and suggestions welcome!

Hopefully some will find this of some use and interest, too :-)

## Categories

- [Assembly (x86)](assembly.x86.md)
- [Atomics, lock free, memory model](atomics.lockfree.memory_model.md)

- [Standardization](std.md)
