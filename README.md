# C++ links

A categorized list of C++ resources.

Being a part of a few C++ communities, I happen to run across some interesting links -- this is an attempt to categorize them. Thanks to Saurabh Malpani from "C++ Enthusiasts" for the suggestion.

An ongoing, work-in-progress effort -- comments, feedback, and suggestions welcome!

Hopefully some will find this of some use and interest, too :-)
